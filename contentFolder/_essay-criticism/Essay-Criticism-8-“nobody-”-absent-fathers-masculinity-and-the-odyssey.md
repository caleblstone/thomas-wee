*Outis* (Οὔτις) <br>— Greek, meaning “nobody” or no one  <br><br>

“Cyclops, you asked my noble name, and I will tell it…My name is Nobody. Nobody I am called  by mother, father, and by all my comrades.” <br>— Homer, *Odyssey*<br><br>

**I. Homecoming**  <br><br>

I know my father through his absence. His death, just before my fourth birthday, robbed  me of the opportunity of knowing him. I know I am not unique in not knowing my father. Literature is rife with fathers who have left, in one form or the other. Many people know their fathers only through their leave-takings, literal or metaphorical. My statement could be just as easily applied to any of the many absent fathers throughout history, stretching as far back perhaps as the original Absent Father of literature himself: Odysseus, the “man of cunning.”  <br><br>

The *Odyssey* is one of our oldest stories. The poem has origins that stretch back further than the first recorded papyri versions from the 8th century, BCE. It is the product of the Greek oral tradition, a story told and retold for generations until someone, conventionally  thought of as a blind poet named Homer hailing from the islands of Smyrna or Chios, thought to  write it down.  <br><br>

There are only two kinds of stories: man leaves home and man returns home*.* Homer’s *Odyssey* is mostly the second kind of story—Odysseus’ winding journey home to Ithaca. But it is also, at some moments, the first. Traditionally thought of as an epic about a hero’s homecoming, the *Odyssey* is also a story about an absent father and the people he leaves behind. It is a *bildungsroman* of sorts—the story of Odysseus’ son, Telemachus, who leaves home at the bidding of the goddess Athena in search of his father. <br><br>

This second narrative, the story of Penelope and Telemachus, is the one Penelope weaves  each day and unravels, secretly, each  night. Until relatively recently, it was largely neglected by ancient authors and scholars who were generally more interested in the story of Odysseus. This second story, of those stuck at home in Ithaca, is less flashy and more quotidian compared to the swashbuckling adventures of Odysseus. It is the story of Odysseus’s household enduring continual abuse at the hands of the suitors who have descended upon the house like a plague. Theirs is primarily a story of domesticity, grief, and waiting.  <br><br>

As a boy, the story of the hero’s journey home captivated me. The stories of Odysseus  and the Sirens. Odysseus navigating through sea monsters. Odysseus outsmarting the cyclops.  However, as I grew older and reencountered the *Odyssey* for a third time, in college, it was this  second plot-line, the “B story”, that captured my attention. \[1]<br><br>

**II. Telemachus**  <br><br>

In college, during a required freshman seminar called “Literature Humanities,” I was forced to  see Homer’s epic with new eyes. In that class I had the experience, which I often seek but rarely  find, when a text seems to stare at you directly. Via a form of X-ray vision, the  text *sees* you*,* momentarily, in disarming totality. This experience with the *Odyssey* was one of  the most intensely personal, almost invasive experiences I’ve ever had with literature. I am almost inclined to call it a religious or spiritual one. It was certainly a moment of revelation for me—the text piercing through the self like a sudden bolt of lightning. Bernini’s *Ecstasy of Saint  Teresa.* Bruegel’s *Conversion of St. Paul.* Or Cyclops’s heat vision in the *X-Men s*eries*.* It was autumn, late September or early October. We had just finished reading the *Iliad*, the first text all freshmen at Columbia College are assigned to read, and were reading the *Odyssey.* This particular moment occurred during a discussion of Telemachus as a character. His role is often overshadowed by that of his father, whose shadow he languishes in for most of the epic. The “hero's journey” is Odysseus’s story. But the *Odyssey* is also a story about Telemachus’s journey, his quest to find his father, and his struggles with masculinity. Put in contemporary terms, Telemachus’s plotline reads like a "crisis of masculinity.” His journey is motivated by a need to “prove himself” in the context of the masculine conventions of Ancient Greece. He does this first by leaving home to find his father, and later, once his father returns, by helping him to chase away Penelope’s suitors. As a character, he reads like a stereotypical teenage boy. He is stubborn, full of angst, occasionally prone to violence, and eager to prove himself  worthy of the title, “son of Odysseus.”  <br><br>

The class discussed Telemachus’s masculinity. The discussion focused on how his traits reflect persistent ideas of masculinity that many have now, rightly, deemed to be “toxic.” Telemachus is often patronizing and paternalistic towards his mother. He treats her as incapable, as lacking agency, and as someone needing to be rescued. He can also be interpreted, I argued \[2] that day in class, within a larger context, as a product of the patriarchal society he grew up in, one in which women were systematically disenfranchised and men ruled over their households like kings.<br><br>

Throughout the epic, this mantle of Athenian masculinity weighs uneasily upon Telemachus’  shoulders. He bristles under the pressure of growing up in the shadow of such a father. He is constantly measuring himself up, and being measured against, his father’s legacy.  <br><br>

In our class discussion, I found myself being critical of but also sympathetic towards Telemachus. More than sympathizing with him, I felt that I understood him on a deep, intimate level. This feeling of identification came to a head when we landed on one particular exchange in Book One*.* In this passage, the goddess Athena*,* disguised as the mentor figure Mentes, has arrived as a guest. Telemachus speaks with this stranger over dinner, eager for any news from this man who claims to have known his father. Athena, in disguise, asks Telemachus: “Tell me now— are you Odysseus’ son?”<br><br>

Telemachus responds (here rendered in Emily Wilson’s translation):\[3]<br><br>

*Dear guest, I will be frank with you. My mother*  <br>

*says that I am his son, but I cannot*  <br>

*be sure, since no one knows his own begetting.*  <br><br>

I forget my exact reaction when we read this passage that morning. I don’t know if I  spoke or commented. I know I couldn’t voice the intense internal reaction I was having, one  which brought me nearly to tears. I was new to college, an anxious freshman who was nervous  about speaking up in class about something so personal. I had heard my father in these lines, and  through the character of Telemachus, saw my own relationship (or non-relationship) with him. At that moment, I felt that I understood Telemachus intimately. I knew how it felt to grow up in theshadow of a father who is unknown to you. That day in seminar, I felt my father’s absence for the first time in years. <br><br>

Telemachus revealed something to me about my own experience with masculinity and the mystery of paternity. Like Telemachus, I knew my father only through the vectors of other people's memories and stories of him. When people ask me about my father, I give my own variation of Telemachus’s reply to Athena. In Book Nine, when the cyclops Polyphemus asks Odysseus his name, Odysseus responds, with characteristic cunning, that he is called “Nobody” (*outis).* Like Telemachus, I am the son of “Nobody.” My own paternal lineage is uncertain. Likewise, I cannot be certain of my own “begetting.”  <br><br>

Our fathers, especially the ones who leave us, always remain for us partially obscured.  And for boys, or those of us socialized to be boys, whether we like it or not, we are destined to grow up under the yoke of our paternal lineage. In response, we tend to grow up either fleeing our fathers or searching for some sort of replacement for them. In the absence of a male role model, we construct our own. Like Telemachus, my father is more myth than reality.  <br><br>

Self-identification—seeing oneself in a text—is traditionally not the most respected form  of literary criticism. It is often seen as naive at best and self-indulgent at worst. However, I  would argue, after having dipped my toes in the other schools of criticism, that self-identification  remains what consistently draws us back to literature, again and again. Although we may deny it,  I believe that we read largely in order to see some version of ourselves, even a highly distorted  one, reflected back at us. Or perhaps we read to see ourselves through another character’s eyes— an alternative version of ourselves, reflected prismatically through the text. For me, the *Odyssey* has had such a hold on my imagination, throughout all these years, because I find myself in the character of Telemachus. More than sympathizing with him, I experience a form of literary self-identification that becomes, through the operation of reading, a miraculous transposition.<br><br>

**III. Reunion**  <br><br>

When Odysseus finally returns to Ithaca, he comes disguised by Athena as an old man. At the home of the swineherd Eumaios, Telemachus, at first, fails to recognize his father. He takes him to be a stranger. After Eumaios leaves, with Athena’s permission, Odysseus finally reveals himself to his son:\[4]<br><br>

*I am that father whom your boyhood lacked*  <br>

*and suffered pain for lack of. I am he.*  <br><br>

Odysseus weeps and embraces his son, but Telemachus, stunned by his sudden appearance after twenty years, doubts that it is really him. The return of his father is both too wonderful and too unlikely. He doubts, because he is afraid to believe such good news. Poignantly, Telemachus exclaims, “You cannot be my father Odysseus! Meddling spirits conceived this trick to twist the knife in me!” \[5]<br><br>

Traces of this scene are later echoed in the Gospels of the New Testament when Christ is resurrected and presents himself to his disciples. The disciple Thomas famously doubts that Christ has returned. He demands proof, asking to see Christ’s wounds so he can stick his finger into Christ’s side. Faced with news that seems too good to be true, he demands tactile evidenceof his teacher’s resurrection. Similarly, Telemachus refuses to believe the impossible fact that his father, long presumed to be dead, has finally returned.  <br><br>

I too have moments when I believe that my father has returned. I don’t believe in an afterlife, at least in the Christian formulation, but having been raised Christian, some kind of latent spirituality remains buried within me. I believe, at the very least, that the borders between life and death are somehow porous. I find it comforting to believe that the dead never truly leave us, that they persist somehow in a shadowy, non-corporeal form.  <br><br>

My father rarely visits my dreams, like he does for my mother, but sometimes I find myself catching fleeting glimpses of him out in the world. When I first moved to New York, I experienced repeated episodes of *deja vu.* These occurred most often in Chinatown, around the Grand Street station. Every tall, thin Asian man I encountered on the street or on the subway platform looked like they could be my father. Mmore somberly, I find my father in the news reports documenting anti-Asian hate crimes. I see his face in the horrific images of bloodied Asian men who have been beaten, stabbed, or murdered.  <br><br>

In various intangible ways, despite his continued absence, my father persists for me. Maybe this is merely the last remnant of denial. The final stage of grief. Or just a form of wishful thinking. I never actually saw my father’s dead body, or if I did, I have no memory of it. And in my stubborn mind, perhaps this allows me to believe that after nearly twenty years, he has lingered. It is not hard for me to imagine that perhaps he might one day show up, at the house of a stranger or at the threshold of my home, perhaps shrouded in some disguise, so that I hardly recognize him.<br><br>

Like Penelope, my mother holds out hope for a reunion, if not in this life, then in the next  one. Like Penelope, after twenty years, she has maintained her faith. She has never remarried or  even dated another man. She claims, and I believe her, that she still loves him, despite— or perhaps because of— his continued absence. In some form or another, we both, I believe, possess a lingering hope. A hope that perhaps everyone has been wrong this whole time, and that my father, after twenty years on a far-flung journey, will someday return.<br><br>
