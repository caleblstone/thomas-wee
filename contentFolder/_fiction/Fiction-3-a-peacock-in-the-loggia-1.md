As a boy, he enjoyed the sound of the word long before he knew its meaning. Not knowing  what the word meant, it took on a variety of disparate meanings for him. *Loggia*, with its unfamiliar  double g’s, which so rarely occurred in English, conjured up for him the little village in Northern  Italy where he was sent every summer to stay with his grandmother. It wasn’t until years later, in a  lecture course on architecture in college, that the boy, who was now a young man, finally learned the  meaning of the word. 

\
He was a student of architecture, and he came across the word, during a dull lecture one  morning on palace aesthetics. Hearing the word, in this far removed context, he was startled by the  memories it conjured up for. Sitting in the back of the dimly lit lecture hall, he was suddenly  overwhelmed by associations. He recalled the slanting rays of sunlight that struck the courtyard in  the afternoons, his grandmother singing in their cramped kitchen, the clouds of dust kicked up in  the streets of the village, the feeling of the sun on his naked back after a swim at the lake, and the  sunburnt bald men who sat in lawn chairs outside of their apartments playing a complicated card  game involving dice. And, above all, he remembered the strange incomparable cry of a peacock  echoing in the courtyard of the *loggia* as it died. Followed by an equally incomparable silence the  morning that it disappeared.  



In-between the double consonants of this word was the memory of this peacock, who  belonged first to the animal dealer who had acquired him by accident, and later, once it had been  freed to roam the apartment courtyard, to everyone. He remembered that it would eat straight from  anyone’s hand, without the slightest fear. The peacock was large, larger than any bird the boy had  seen back home, with a tremendous beak and a great blue robe of plumage that resembled a medieval tapestry. It terrified the small children in the neighborhood and was even known to have  bitten a few of them. But apart from getting into squabbles sometimes with the other animals, it was  mostly harmless and spent most of its days parading the courtyard, which had become, after a brief  stint in captivity, its kingdom. 

\
At first, he was afraid of the bird, until he learned that its threats were mostly bluster and  that its diet consisted primarily of figs, berries, and seeds. During his early visits to the *loggia*, his  memories of the peacock were of a young, strapping bird with a brilliant, shimmering blue hue and  impressive plumage, especially during mating season. Its feathers could be found everywhere, drifted  into corners, tucked in the rafters of rooms, flittering off balconies. They were considered to be good luck and were often seen adorning peoples’ clothes, dangling from earrings, or tucked into a  woman’s hair. 



Initially, the peacock belonged to the local animal dealer, a thin-lipped, brooding man with a  heavy brow. The boy’s grandmother had warned him to stay away from him, because the man, they  said, drank, gambled, frequented brothels, and used birth control. He sold animals at the market in the middle of town. Ordinary livestock mostly, but occasionally he managed to get his hands on  rarer, more exotic fauna. These he kept in a metal cage attached to the outside of his ground-floor  apartment. The children in the village, including the boy, would stand by the cage, poking their hands through the bars, to pet or feed the animals. 

\
The peacock was kept in the cage until the noises during its scuffles began to irritate the  neighbors. It seemed that the bird was unhappy being cooped up among these other animals—goats,  chickens, sheep, or rarer animals such as lizards, snakes, or sometimes an occasional chimp—animals  which were obviously lesser compared to itself. Either way, it made much less noise when the dealer  finally gave in and released the peacock into the courtyard of the *loggia*. At first, people were worried  it would fly away. The courtyard was accessed by a metal gate that led onto a street, but the walls of  the buildings that enclosed it were only four stories high. No one knew if peacocks could fly. At most, all they had witnessed from it was the occasional hop and a great fluttering of wings, but it  had never managed to get more than a meter off the ground.   



The boy came to the *loggia*, summer after summer. His grandmother, a widow, spent most  of her days indoors except when she was out on the balcony, shouting across to her neighbors. The  boy was left largely to his own devices, as long as came back at the end of each day for supper. As  the boy grew older, he began spending more time in town or the woods, lounging on the steps of  the cathedral in the town square, smoking cigarettes that the older boys rolled for him, or else in the  woods, going for swims in the nearby lake. 

\
The peacock still lived in the courtyard. It hadn’t once attempted to escape, either from lack  of ability or lack of trying. The animal dealer had tried for years to find someone to buy it off him.  It was expensive to keep, he said, and noisy. He went from door to door in nearby towns, dragging  the peacock behind him in a hand-pulled cart. Nobody wanted to buy such an expensive, pointless  bird. After a few years of trying and failing to sell it, he tried instead to find it a mate. The peacock  was now in its middle-age, and the dealer imagined that a brood of younger peacocks would be  flashier and thus more profitable. But in this, he was also unsuccessful. He had stumbled upon the  first peacock by accident when a shipment of iguanas was lost off the coast of Lisbon, and he was  given the lone peacock by a trader as a form of compensation. Male peacocks, because of their  plumage, are more desirable and thus easier to obtain through illicit means. But female peacocks,  with their dull, tawny color, are less coveted and harder to come by. And so, the peacock, despite the  dealer’s best efforts, remained in the courtyard, an eternal bachelor, to be fed and teased with sticks  and laughed at by the neighbors. 



“What a stupid, pointless bird,” they would say. 

\
The boy, who was now a teenager, was no longer afraid of the bird. By now, he had begun to  shave and his voice had dropped and, one summer, he had discovered girls. His friends in the  neighborhood drove motor scooters and he would ride on their backs as they rode around the  village and into the countryside where they swam, drank, and made out with one another. At night,  drunk, stumbling back into the courtyard, they would tease the peacock in its nest before going to  bed. They threw pebbles at it until it squawked and stomped its feet and kicked up dust with its  wings, generally making such a racket that it invariably woke everyone up. 



One night, the boy was sitting with two neighborhood girls after a day of drinking at the  lake. The other boys had gone to the pool hall, and he had somehow managed to end up with the  two of them, alone, in a shaded corner of the courtyard. They were sitting on a moss-covered bench  under an aging willow, still drunk, laughing and teasing each other. The boy was nervous. For some reason, two of the most beautiful girls in the entire village had decided to spend the evening with him. Now that he was alone with the two of them, he felt he needed to impress them somehow. He  had already earned a reputation in the neighborhood for being timid and inexperienced. Everyone  around him seemed to be growing up at an alarming rate. When he arrived that summer, he’d  discovered that everyone he knew, it seemed, had lost their virginity while he was away. Sitting under the willow, the girls were getting bored and sleepy. They looked at each other like they  were about to leave. The boy was about to say something when there was the sound of branches  breaking and the peacock crashed through some ferns. It emerged, out of the darkness, and  unfurled its enormous shield of feathers, its black eye glittering in the moonlight. After a moment, the peacock relaxed its chest, collapsed its feathers, and eyed them warily,  releasing a kind of whine that sounded like a vacuum cleaner. It was old at this point, and everyone was surprised that it was still alive. No one knew how long peacocks lived, because this was the only  one they had seen. By now, its feathers had begun to lose their luster and its tail drooped behind it  when it walked. Every year, when he arrived at the *loggia*, he half expected to find that it had died. 

\
But each time, he was surprised to find the peacock still alive. He thought, in his drunkenness, that it  was ridiculous that a creature like this, impotent, stupid, pointless, should live so long. Interrupting  the girls, who had resumed teasing him, he picked up an empty beer bottle resting against a pile of  bricks. The girls stopped laughing and looked at him nervously, daring him, it seemed, with their eyes.  



“You wouldn’t,” one of them gasped. She was smiling at him, and her demeanor had  changed all of a sudden. He stood up straighter, weighed the bottle in his hand.  Just then, the bird waddled in front of them and squawked. Its beak wobbled. He shouted at  it, imitating its screech. The three of them laughed. One of the girls moved to put a hand on his  arm. The bird did a kind of a hop, turned, and was about to leave. The boy, seizing the opportunity,  lifted the bottle and hurled it. The bottle exploded in a whirlwind of feathers, scattering fragments  of glass in the dust. There was the sound of shattering and then an abrupt, painful cry. The peacock  fled, kicking up dirt, diving into the ferns and out of sight. 

\
In the silence that followed, the girls stared at him. He realized that they weren’t at all  impressed by what he had done. Instead, they looked furious and disgusted. One of them spat in the  dirt. She looked at her friend and the two of them stood and dusted themselves off. Then they  turned and walked with their backs to him. The metal gate clanged shut behind them, echoing  against the walls of the courtyard. The boy looked at the cloud of dust where the girls and the  peacock had been and sighed. Drunk, he lay down against the bench and fell asleep underneath the stars. 

\
In the morning, he awoke to an awful sound. It was almost a human noise, as if a person were  crying out for help somewhere in the distance. He covered his ears, groaning, hungover, and sat up.  His back ached from sleeping on the ground. Although it was still early, he heard voices clamoring above him. He looked up and saw people clustered on their balconies. They were shouting to each  other, “What is that noise! That horrible noise!”  



The boy stood up. He saw, a few meters from him, a pile of shards and a few stray feathers  scattered in the dirt. The night before came back to him in a rush. He was annoyed at himself. It had  been an impulsive, stupid decision, and he regretted it. That entire day, the courtyard echoed with  unrelenting cries. Its source was quickly identified as an animal, dying somewhere. A group of  concerned neighbors roused the animal dealer from his afternoon nap. He listened and quickly  identified the cries as the sound his peacock made when it was hurt after a fight. He told them he  hadn’t seen it since the day before. The cries persisted into the night, and the dealer became  concerned. His peacock was still missing. Together, the neighbors organized a search of the  courtyard and the area around the *loggia*. The boy watched all of this unfold from his grandmother’s  balcony.  

\
The peacock’s body was found eventually, curled up among a pile of rubble in a neglected  corner of the courtyard. The dealer’s cursing could be heard from below. He had found pieces of  glass stuck in the bird’s breast, he said. Someone had done this intentionally. The animal dealer, who  had never once shown any particular affection for the bird, became the perfect picture of righteous  indignation. He referred to what happened as a “crime”, demanding that the culprit be found and  swiftly punished. He offered a sizable reward for anyone who came forward with information about  the attacker’s identity. Terrified of being found out, the boy fled the courtyard to wait for things to  blow over. He ran into town and out into the fields under the pretext of buying food for his  grandmother. He stayed out there, alone, for the entire day, wandering aimlessly through the woods  until night fell. 



When he returned that night, he smelled dinner cooking in the apartments and found a  group of men sitting in beach chairs arranged in a circle. The older men and the animal dealer were  conversing. The boy lingered outside the door to his apartment and listened to their whispers. They still hadn’t found the culprit, he learned, but there were several promising leads. The question  currently under debate was what should be done about the bird. There was a doctor in a nearby  village who sometimes treated animals, livestock mostly. But when the dealer visited him, the man  told him that the bird was too far gone already and that the most merciful thing to do would be to  put it out of its misery. The doctor offered to do it for him, via lethal injection, but the dealer  refused, and took his bird home with him, bringing it into his house, hoping to nurse it back to  health. 

\
The men he sat in council with offered their advice. “It can’t have much time left. I say, just  wait and let things run their course,” one said. Another suggested that the most humane thing to do  would be to let it run free, to live out its final days in the woods above town.  “Don’t be ridiculous,” the dealer said, “that bird is too used to his comfortable life here. He  won’t last a night out there, fending for himself.”  



The other nodded. It was true. The bird was utterly domesticated. There was silence. The  men sighed to themselves. Seeing no alternative, the dealer stood up and went inside, hoping that a  solution would emerge tomorrow.  

\
That night, no one in the *loggia* slept. The peacock kept everyone up with its screeches. It sounded like someone was wringing a rooster’s neck, and just when it seemed to have stopped, it  would start up again, even louder. The bird was, everyone agreed, at the end of its life. It wouldn’t  be much longer. They all went out on their balconies, looking down at the dealer’s apartment and the  outdoor cage where the peacock had been moved. They each secretly wished that the dealer would  do the compassionate thing. He owned a rifle, they knew, and had loaded it the day he found the  bird’s body. Now, it lay beside his bed, but he couldn’t bring himself to shoot it. The boy lay awake listening to the mangled cries and covered his ears with a pillow. He could hear  his grandmother awake in the next room, murmuring a prayer. He refused to feel any guilt, which had consumed him in the past few days. Now, he simply wished that the bird would die. It was stubborn, he thought, even in death. 



The animal dealer held out for three days. For three nights, nobody slept. They tried stuffing  cotton balls in their ears, playing loud music, but nothing could cover up the cries. They all walked to  work with dark circles under their eyes and were more irritable than usual. Children disobeyed their  parents. Husbands fought with their wives. The boy’s grandmother was short with him when she realized he had forgotten to buy milk. 

\
For three days, the boy rode a bicycle into the woods, alone, to skip rocks in the lake and  grow sunburned in the late August sun. Each evening, he returned home as late as he dared, and  tried and failed to fall asleep to the cries of the peacock. Contrary to their expectations, as the days  passed and its death was prolonged, its cries only grew stronger. After the third night, the dealer  gave in. In the morning, as usual, the boy left for town and went into the fields. He missed the event  and only heard about it later, from the rumors. The dealer had conducted everything in secret, early  that morning, as if out of modesty and deference. 



When the boy finally returned, the bird was gone. The gossip from the balconies that night  gave several conflicting accounts. Some swore that early in the morning, they had heard a shot fired  from behind the apartments, which startled the pigeons in the town square. Others were equally  certain that they had seen the dealer wheeling his cart into the woods at sunrise. Some posited a  third possibility. This theory was so improbable that it was mocked mercilessly and only believed by a few. No one had ever seen the bird fly before, and so it was impossible to believe, as some claimed, that something so ungainly could have managed to escape on its own accord, that morning, just before dawn.
