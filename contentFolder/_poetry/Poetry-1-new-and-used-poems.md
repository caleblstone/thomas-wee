***Generation Loss***

*This poem was written in English and translated into Chinese using an online translation program. The result was translated back into English. This process was repeated three times.*

*<br>*

**V.1:**

Definition:

“The loss of quality between successive copies, usually associated with magnetic audio and video media.”

<br>

My great grandfather

Left his family in Guangdong Port of entry: unknown

We have distant relatives in Canada, perhaps he emigrated there

One Family legend says that he and his wife came together. Another story says they came separately, and that he left her in China, waiting.

In the version where they come together, they arrive in California, buy a train ticket for as Far East as they can afford.

It takes them to Wichita, a tiny dot on the white plains of Kansas.

<br>

My grandfather came to this country Illegally. Under an assumed identity.

The term for the many Chinese men who came with false papers is “Paper Son” Sometime during this translation

Our names were trans	placed

My middle name, which can mean horse indicates that my ancestors likely raised horses My last name is a fiction, a false signifier

an invention of bureaucracy

<br>

My father was born in Wichita, KS..

He spoke Chinese at home and English at school. He competed with his four brothers

At night in their shared bedroom they played mental chess, the board and its pieces A figment of their collective imagination

He learned English by watching television And listening to the soundtracks to musicals *Hello Dolly, Singing in the Rain,*

He and his brothers spoke Chinese at a middle school level. A fragmented, diasporic Chinese

<br>

My father died three years after I was born 

He died without leaving me the inheritance of 

Even his tattered language

Growing up,

I ask my uncles to transcribe him to me I ask my mother to recreate him for me A set of letters he wrote on his deathbed, Which I rediscovered at 18

Our only correspondence

<br>

My Chinese is only the faintest memory A weak link in the chain of signifiers

A corrupted image

the last layer of the family palimpsest

<br>

<br>

**V.2:**

definition:

"The quality loss between successive copies is usually related to magnetic audio and video media."

<br>

My great grandfather

Leave family in Guangdong Port of entry: unknown

We have distant relatives in Canada, maybe he immigrated there

A family legend said he got together with his wife. Another story says that they were separated and he left her in China and waited.

In the version where they came together, they arrived in California and bought train tickets as far as possible.

They took them to Wichita, a small spot on the white plains of Kansas.

<br>

My grandfather came to this country illegal. Under the assumed identity.

For many Chinese men with forged documents, the term is "paper son" At some point in the translation process

Our name was transferred

My middle name may mean horse, which indicates that my ancestors may have raised horses My last name is fictitious, false representation

The invention of bureaucracy

<br>

My father was born in Wichita, Kansas.

He speaks Chinese at home and English at school. He competes with his four brothers

In the shared bedroom at night, they played the mind chess, the board and its pieces Their collective imagination

<br>

He learns English by watching TV

And listen to the soundtrack of the musical Hello Dolly, singing in the rain,

He and his brother speak Chinese in middle school. Fragmented Chinese

<br>

My father died three years after my birth 

He died without leaving my legacy 

Even his broken language

<br>

growing up,

I asked uncle to copy it to me

I want my mother to be born again for me A set of letters he wrote before his death, I rediscovered when I was 18

Our only counterpart

<br>

My Chinese is just the lightest memory Weak link in the indicator chain

Image corruption

The last floor of the family

<br> <br>

**V.3:**

"The loss of quality between successive copies is usually associated with magnetic audio and video media."

<br>

My great-grandfather.

<br>

Leave your family in Guangdong. Port of entry: unknown

We have distant relatives in Canada. Maybe he's emigrated to Canada.

One family legend says that he and his wife were together. Another story says that they separated and he left her waiting in China.

In the version they came together, they went to California and bought train tickets as far as they could.

They took them to Wichita, a small place on the white plains of Kansas.

<br>

My grandfather came to this country. It's illegal. Under a fake identity.

For many Chinese men with fake IDs, it's "pieces of paper." At some point in the translation process

Our names have been moved.

<br>

<br>

**signi • fication**

*After Deleuze*

<br><br>

what’s in a name? —

\[the ghosts of ancestors, immigration, flight] buried in the encrusted syllables

of imperfect transliteration

Diaspora & Dispersal, or let’s call it entropy:

culture neutered+*naturalized* 

(read: ANESTHETIZED)

to a grey death

<br>

\[if my family gave me a Chinese name it was never written down] 

<br>

call it genealogy,

traced through the contours of your tongue 

as it dribbles

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; out

&emsp;&emsp; dactyls // spondees // syllables

twitching out my name which you 

whisper into my spine

<br>

hold it in your lips and feel it rise 

somewhere in your gullet,bristling,

near the sternum.

A viscous sound / a raised fist

like Adam, you point and name things 

making word flesh

<br>

someone said

that the body is our first language

the fetus in the womb, a floating signifier

<br>

Or maybe to be seen

the same, nearly, as hearing your name 

spoken by the beloved

&emsp;&emsp;(transcendence, signified)

the effect of being held, momentarily naked&warm, in the lover’s mouth

<br>

<br>

**Speech Acts**

<br>

*“whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent”* *— Ludwig Wittgenstein*

<br><br>



I climb daily

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; in the crater of language

Desiring sentences that are like

shafts of light

cutting &emsp;&emsp; through densest fog

Words hard &emsp;&emsp; & &emsp;&emsp; razor &emsp;&emsp; sharp

like iron — &emsp;&emsp; hot from the anvil.

<br><br>



Instead, I worry my molars

gargling phonemes, I spit

blood and call it

Speech, acting

(and all of us the poorest players)

<br><br>



Silence is always an option — yes

But muteness its own kind of speech

And most of us do not have

The fortitude for silence

<br><br>



So instead each day

we confront

the muck of conversation.

I pull on my boots,

and wade in

to dip my net

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; into the Great Stream of Utterances

<br><br>



Each poet has considered silence.

Has weighed the blank page

And all its implications

Only to chose our thinest, paltriest

Language. Returning to it, at first, like the jilted lover

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; (with reluctance)

but eventually greeting it

with inky lips:

Each word written— a joyous refusal

<br><br>



**Stagecraft**

<br><br>

(noun) *Def:*

A definition &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; OR

an &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; evasive &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; maneuver

a defiant assertion &emsp;&emsp; OR

an attempt at the continuous

,,,elision,,,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; of oneself

<br><br>



I perform

mostly to an audience of one

because, unfortunately:

\[&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;] requires an audience.

<br><br>



I explicate myself

“ I perform ” “ gyrations ” to the “ public ”

linguistic stripteases draped in velour

bending my tongue in contortionist knots

I make &emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp; ambiguity

&emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp;quiver

like a dancer in the cage

<br><br>



beckoning mocking imploring

like &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; onstage at the Globe

the air:

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; (horse manure, unwashed souls, chloroform, dung)

I stand

getting pelted by roses and occasionally

spat upon

by groundlings in the pit

<br><br>



if someone transitions in a forest:

is it still a transition?

is the univocal, uni-vocal affirmation

of oneself —

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; ululations in an open field

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; a voice shaking the trees

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; — enough?

<br><br>



could \[gender] just be a poem

written to the wind?

<br><br>



**A Flat Circle**

<br><br>



We too often speak of a person’s transition as a series of static, singular events:

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The Surgery

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The Coming Out

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The First Regiment of Hormones

<br><br>



This obscures the reality of transitioning as a prolonged, sustained act.

A continuous reimagining of the self.

<br><br>



Similarly, people mark the changes in seasons with arbitrary events:

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The First Snow (the beginning of winter)

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The First Thaw (the beginning of spring)

<br><br>



In doing so, they neglect the fact that it was already winter, already spring. That somewhere along the way, through infinitesimal gradations, the seasons had shifted, gone unnoticed by the casual observer.

<br><br>



Or to put it into geometrical terms:

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; A circle is made up of infinite points.

<br><br>



To isolate the beginning of someone’s transition is to attempt to find one point on the circle, a

seam, where the circle begins and ends.

<br><br>



**The yellow settee**

(2018)

*After Gertrude Stein*

<br><br>



&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Fragment of her great-grandmother’s lost Lebanon. With curling feet & diasporic stains. Threadbare, we unlost it each evening. We sat and unfolded our legs double decker. Summer stank when We sweated the other. Breathless at the firstness of things. Dangling we were on the edge of shifting questions. Enthralled with ifs and with rarer because. Blushing at the nakedness of the sentence. The slow striptease of the mind. Fetid July up drifted her ever-present question of sex. Licking at our windows. But always enough for me was the talking. The embrace of that fleeting speculative We.

<br><br>



**Pomegranate**

<br><br>

like some puckered fruit,

a pomegranate perhaps

this unreliable

receptacle which we

douse daily rinsing

dimpled flesh

in this daily stream

we call Life.

<br><br>



(how could we possibly expect it to hold it all?)

<br><br>



each memory

&emsp;&emsp; *dislodges*

another.

a seed. &emsp;&emsp; a pit.

Rattle like

teeth &emsp;&emsp; Spat

into the sink

I dreamed writing

might stymie this

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Drip.

<br><br>



so I wrote a temporary repair

each day frantically

duck-taping my vessel

bursting as waters

rising each day

plugging.

a hole. &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; a word.

<br><br>



I found I succeeded

only in ( false )replication

the coating of deadflesh

\[in deaderwords]

I became a master

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; of taxidermy.

<br><br>



we have been equipped

with so many

ways of Forgetting

<br><br>



**in the garden of St. John**

<br><br>



this time of year with its

multicolored silences

makes me think of my Father

\[who dies each spring]

on Amsterdam leaves conspire

on the pavement a haphazard mosaic

makes light music in

the chanting wind

fall — a form of forgetting

<br><br>



in the garden of St. John the Divine

a peacock

admires itself

contemplates &emsp;&emsp; the Problem of Evil

recites &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; the Nicene Creed

<br><br>



*I believe in* &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; *one LORD*

*Jesus Christ, the Only*

*Begotten Son*

*of God born* &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; *of the Father*

*before all ages*

*God from God* &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; *Light from Light*

<br><br>



I awaken to bells dripping

from morning’s pipette

each one a golden lozenge

outside of the deli I see a man

who looks JUST like &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; my Father

who looks like the image of &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; my Father

who looks like how I imagined &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; my Father

who looks like someone’s image of &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; the Father

<br><br>



*...consubstantial with the Father*

*through him*

*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; all things were made*

<br><br>



under the portico, in the rain

on the steps of the cathedral

you teach me the names of the saints

<br><br>



*HE will come again in glory*

*to judge the living and the dead*

*and his kingdom will have no end*

<br><br>



I run his name over my lips

my tongue a well-worn rosary

Intoning &emsp; Intoning &emsp; Intoning
