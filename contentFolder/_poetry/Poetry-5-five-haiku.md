1

evening morning 

cries and quieted with age 

on mount yoshino 

<br> 

2

die out sleep on a 

voice autumn blow yet not 

petals of plum blossoms 

<br>

3

it is something 

this autumn deep into the 

all with mud in cherry 

<br>

 4

a wanderer so 

singing singing singing winter 

old pond a chance 

<br>

5

all the waterfall 

piercing like to wet the gate 

is the morning mist
