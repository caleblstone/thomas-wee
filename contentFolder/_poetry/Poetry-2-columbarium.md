**I.**
*noun.*
From the Latin, *columba*
&emsp;&emsp; meaning “dove”
In Chinese, *naguta*
&emsp;&emsp; “a pagoda-of-bones”
<br><br>


this &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; dovecote
with its | lattice-work of shelves |
pockmarked &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; by &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; urns
one recalls:
&emsp;&emsp; the dome of the Pantheon
&emsp;&emsp; Borges and his infinite library
<br><br>


in its sheltering arms
porous, permeating, perforated
&emsp;&emsp; like skin under a microscope
&emsp;&emsp; or a chestnut
&emsp;&emsp; its dark, brawny husk
&emsp;&emsp; guarding the tender flesh
<br><br>


there’s a word in Chinese
*&emsp;&emsp; yiwu* (遺物): &emsp;&emsp; “leftover"
something discarded & remaindered
which we
&emsp;&emsp; embalm with associations
&emsp;&emsp; maunder with meanings
<br><br>


these few, worthless things
the deceased
have forgotten
left behind:
&emsp;&emsp; \[too worn shoes,
&emsp;&emsp; a dozen, burnished coins
&emsp;&emsp; a pair of cracked
&emsp;&emsp; spectacles]
<br><br>


if I have anything like Religion
it might be
&emsp;&emsp; Etymology
<br><br>


&emsp;&emsp; for I enjoy nothing more
&emsp;&emsp; than the opening up of words
&emsp;&emsp; dismantling
&emsp;&emsp; their little boxes
<br><br>


&emsp;&emsp; and, like a well
&emsp;&emsp; peering down
<br><br>


&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; into them.
<br><br>


**II.**

<br><br>


In this
budding grove &emsp;&emsp;  I sit
on a mossy, lover’s bench
under an aged sycamore
<br><br>


on some decomposing, Irish estate
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; amid cornflowers
my presence disrupts
a tendentious stillness
<br><br>


With one careless movement
I startle them
&emsp;&emsp; their cries &emsp;&emsp; echo
&emsp;&emsp; from so many
&emsp;&emsp; small places
<br><br>


suddenly,
&emsp;&emsp; a gust of wind lifts
&emsp;&emsp; the ground swells
&emsp;&emsp; a shroud of white,
&emsp;&emsp; rippling, brilliant
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; momentarily blots the sun

<br><br>
