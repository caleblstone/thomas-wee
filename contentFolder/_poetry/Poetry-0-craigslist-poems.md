**The Cab That Almost Hit You On Market** 

It was early afternoon on Saturday you were on your bike on Market Street and completely unaware that you were facing oncoming traffic particularly the speeding cab I was riding in The driver skidded to a stop, and you apologized to him with a sheepish smile. I was glad to get a closer look at you. Want to join me for a (less life-threatening) bike ride sometime?

**Laila**

Lets both get divorced and marry each other again. 

I miss you  and me. 

And I'm not the only one.
