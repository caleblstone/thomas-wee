**\*Author’s Note:** The title of this poem is taken from the poem by John Ashberry, “Self-Portrait in A Convex Mirror”. These poems were generated by a computer based off a corpus of around twenty-five poems, written over the course of the years 2016-2021. These poems cover a variety of reoccurring themes including: grief, assimilation, loss, memory, and language. These poems were run into a modified version of Open AI’s natural language processing program GPT-2 and lightly edited. The resulting highly experimental poems, taken as a whole, is a self-portrait of sorts, an auto-poiesis. It is a portrait of the author through the medium of a computer.*

**I Sit On A Gallows**

<br><br>

<pre>
Embroiled,
you plead infirmities
                          in withdrawing out of debt
                          I sit
                                       on a gallows
                          square
                          watching morning's movements

                          obliterate
                          the poem
                          Aid to the forgotten
                          void theater

                          Diesel,
            watching empty areas
                          Frisian eyebrow, Sanskrit curls
                          pale, humped horses.
                          They wade into river
                          to learn more
                          see the fruit of firm gender
                          appear in public bearing wares
                          making
                          your presence taught
                          that sometimes,
                          watching its part,
                          watching flower.)
LEAVE.

**The Ancestors of China**

placed the seed of                     a plump being
            Grows ——
            pale anchored              like the rest of
            the earth’s
            floors
            amid cornflowers
            rising,
            watching the fields
            watching dawn
            watching the sky
            watching dawn
            watching from the East
                                      the Father
            Hearts arise
            Suddenly,
                         from the Father
            From the Father,
            Hearts come
                         From the Mother,
            Evening is about to begin
                         Light matures
            Suddenly,
            from the Father,
            Approach.
                         Our very being
                                adapted for living

**Deva Eveland:** Could you describe in more detail how the GPT-2 program transformed the original writing?

<br><br>

**Thomas Wee:** GPT is a highly advanced piece of Natural Language Processing software developed by OpenAI that allows a computer to generate highly human-like strings of text. I was using GPT-2 for this project, although a newer more sophisticated version, GPT-3 has already been developed. The software is basically a “black box” unless you have an extensive background in computer science. Luckily, for people like me with only a basic grasp of computer science, people have built programs that let you manipulate GPT without having to work directly with its innards. With GPT, you can give it any body of text and it will “learn” the characteristics of the writing and eventually be able to mimic it with a high degree of accuracy. It obviously has a lot of limitations, which I discovered when attempting to have it write prose in another part of the project, but the results it can produce are, I think, already incredibly generative and interesting.

<br><br>

For this project, I trained the computer on about forty pages of poetry and had it generate several lines or stanzas at a time. The resulting “poems” are not merely modifications of the originals, but “original” creations by the computer. As a result, I hesitate to call these poems mere “transformations” of the originals. Although this is up for debate, I’d argue that these poems are original compositions by the computer inspired by the language, style, and syntax of my original poems.

<br><br>

**DE:** You say your experiment has resulted in a self-portrait. How is it more of a self-portrait than if the original poems had not been modified? What is it about the process that created such a result?

<br><br>

**TW:** As a poet, my style is autobiographical, so the poems that constituted the source material for the GPT-2 program are drawn heavily from my own lived experience. The poems themselves could be considered miniature self-portraits, slivers of reflected images of my life. Put through the computer, the result was a startling “refraction” of these images. It was honestly uncanny and a bit disturbing to read a computer that had been trained to mimic my writing. The experience was unique and very hard to describe.

<br><br>

The resulting poems generated by the computer, I think, feel more like spontaneous self-portraits than the original, more labored, intentionally composed poems. I guess I’d describe these computer-generated poems, in keeping with the theme, as being candid self-portraits. Since composing them, I find them to be more revealing and, interestingly enough, “authentic” than my original poems. Reading these poems is a bit like hearing your own voice on a recording, or seeing a photograph taken of the back of your head.
