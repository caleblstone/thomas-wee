**\*Author’s Note:** The title of this poem is taken from the poem by John Ashberry, “Self-Portrait in A Convex Mirror”. These poems were generated by a computer based off a corpus of around twenty-five poems, written over the course of the years 2016-2021. These poems cover a variety of reoccurring themes including: grief, assimilation, loss, memory, and language. These poems were run into a modified version of Open AI’s natural language processing program GPT-2 and lightly edited. The resulting highly experimental poems, taken as a whole, is a self-portrait of sorts, an auto-poiesis. It is a portrait of the author through the medium of a computer.*

**You Pay Homage**
<pre>


you pay       homage  practitioner                     to my name
                        you have paid       homage                 to your family
                        you have bestowed        * 牴      on                  one
                        of the Father                             of the Son
                        of the Holy Spirit

                                    of the Father                             of the Son
                                    of the Holy Ghost

                                    of the Father                             of the Son
                                    of the Holy Name

**I Sit On A Gallows**
<pre>



Embroiled,
you plead infirmities
                          in withdrawing out of debt
                          I sit
                                       on a gallows
                          square
                          watching morning's movements

                          obliterate
                          the poem
                          Aid to the forgotten
                          void theater

                          Diesel,
            watching empty areas
                          Frisian eyebrow, Sanskrit curls
                          pale, humped horses.
                          They wade into river
                          to learn more
                          see the fruit of firm gender
                          appear in public bearing wares
                          making
                          your presence taught
                          that sometimes,
                          watching its part,
                          watching flower.)
LEAVE.
