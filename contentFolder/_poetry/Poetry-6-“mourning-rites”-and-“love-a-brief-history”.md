**Mourning Rites**  

From the *Book of Rites*

<br><br>

**I.**

<br><br>

*When one sees at a distance a coffin with the corpse in it*

*he should not sing.*

*When he enters among the mourners*

*he should not keep his arms stuck out*

*When eating with others*

*he should not sigh*

*When there is a body shrouded and coffined in his village*

*One should not sing in the lanes*	

*When presenting himself at any mourning rite*

*he should have a sad countenance*

*When holding the rope*

*he should not laugh*

*When going to a burying-ground*

*he should not sing*

<br><br>

**II.**

<br><br>

*At the mourning rites for a parent, the son occupied the slanting shed*

*He slept on straw, with a clod of earth for a pillow*

*He spoke of nothing*		

*except what related to the rites*

<br><br>

**III.** 

<br><br>

*A son, who had hurried to the mourning rites of his father* 

*bound up his hair in the raised hall*

*bared his chest*

*descended to the court* 

*There, he performed his leaping.* 

*The leaping over* 

*he reascended*

*covered his chest,*

*and put on his sash* 

*in an apartment to the east*
